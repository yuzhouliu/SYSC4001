To run the program, follow these steps:

1) Run "make". 2 executables will be generated: producer and consumer.

2) Run ./producer and ./consumer in separate terminals. 
   Order does not matter. 
   If you start producer first and the file is so large that buffer is full, it will wait for consumer.
   If you start consumer first, it will wait for the producer.

3) The Producer prints how many bytes read from input file and copied to shared memory.
   The Consumer prints how many bytes read from shared memory and copied to output file.

3) The contents of "_text_input.txt" will be copied to "_text_output.txt"

4) Modify the contents of "_text_input.txt" as you wish and retest.



Notes: 

Running "make clean" will remove .o, executable files, and the _text_output.txt.
