Steps to run:

1) Run "make" to compile  (make clean to delete executables)
2) Make will compile 4 executables
3) Run the following in seperate xterm terminals in the following order:
	- ./controller
	- ./cloud
	- ./sensor <sensor_name> <threshold>
	- ./actuator <actuator_name>

   where:
     <sensor_name> is for example: temp, humidity, etc
     <actuator_name> is for example: AC, dehumidifier, etc
     <threshold> must be integer between 0 and 10

4) You can create up to 5 sensors and actuators.
   The program maps sensor1 to actuator1, sensor2 to actuator2, etc.

   Controller [Child] prints when:
    - sensor is over threshold
    - activating actuator and actuator has replied

   Controller [Parent] prints when:
    - sensor has gone over threshold and the message needs to be passed onto the cloud

5) To end the program properly, do (CTRL+C) on the controller process. 
   It will tell devices and cloud to end. Then close the message queue and FIFO.
   Then it will end itself.
